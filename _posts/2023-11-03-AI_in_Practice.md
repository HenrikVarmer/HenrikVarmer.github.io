title: AI in Practice 
---

Recently, I gave a talk at Solita Summit 2023. The topic for the summit was Generative AI and the other speakers were Google CTO Ted Sch√∂nbeck, and Kela CIO Janne Pulkkinen. All talks revolved around adoption of Generative AI and going beyond the hype and focusing on actual use cases and solving business problems. 

Solita Summit 2023 was a hybrid event with 50 in-person participants (mostly CEO's and CTO's) and 1500 people joined online for the livestream. My talk was titled 'AI in practice and how we got there' and I spent my time showcasing some of the AI models that we have in production at Lederne, and documenting the business impact they've had.
